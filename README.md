# Fluidly take-home challenge

Here is my attempt at writing an assertEquals function. I have used Jest to test it. 

This was set as a take home challenge for Fluidly/Oak North. 

To view the test results in the terminal run the following commands:
- `git clone https://github.com/AlexPD93/fluidly-take-home-challenge.git`
- `npm install --save-dev jest`
- `npm test`
