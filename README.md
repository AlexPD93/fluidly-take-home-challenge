# Fluidly take-home challenge

Here is my attempt at writing an assertEquals function and using Jest to test it. 

To view the test results in the terminal run the following commands:
- `git clone https://github.com/AlexPD93/fluidly-take-home-challenge.git`
- `npm install --save-dev jest`
- `npm test`
